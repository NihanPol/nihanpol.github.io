I am a radio and gravitational wave astronomer, currently working as a NANOGrav postdoctoral fellow at Oregon State University and a visiting scientist at University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee. I am a member of the [North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav)](https://nanograv.org/) and the [International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA)](https://ipta4gw.org/). I am currently the co-chair of the Gravitational Wave Analysis working group in the IPTA.

Before this, I was a Vanderbilt Initiative in Data-intensive Astrophysics (VIDA) postdoctoral fellow at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, TN. I obtained my PhD in Physics and Astronomy from West Virginia University in 2020, where my research focused on modeling the Galactic double neutron star population.

My research focuses on using millisecond pulsars as extremely precise clocks distributed throughout the Galaxy to detect gravitational waves (GWs). These GWs have frequencies on the order of nanohertzs, meaning that they cannot be detected with any of the ground-based gravitational wave detectors on Earth. In fact, in 2023, NANOGrav and our partners in the IPTA showed, for the first time, evidence for the presence of a stochastic gravitational background. We are now working to determine the source of the gravitational wave background, as well as searching for other signals at nanohertz GW frequencies. Apart from this, I am also interested in studying binary pulsar systems and modeling the pulsar population in the Galaxy.
