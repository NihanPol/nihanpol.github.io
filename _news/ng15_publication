title: Landmark NANOGrav 15 yr results released
---

[We released results](https://nanograv.org/news/15yrRelease) that showed, for the first time, evidence for the presence of a stochastic gravitational wave background permeating the Universe at nanohertz frequencies. 

[Here's a great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2EKbvnee3o) summarizing our work with this dataset, and the [press conference at NSF headquarters announcing our results](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkdyVA0xiVI).

In addition to [leading the search for anisotropy in the gravitational wave background](https://nanograv.org/15yr/Summary/Anisotropy), I also developed the noise analysis framework for [the timing analyses](https://nanograv.org/15yr/Summary/Timing), led the simulations team in the search for the isotropic background, co-led the investigation of the monopole, and was one of the people who wrote the [paper showing evidence for the isotropic background](https://nanograv.org/15yr/Summary/Background).
