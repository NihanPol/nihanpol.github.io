title: Landmark NANOGrav 15 yr results released
---

<a href="https://nanograv.org/news/15yrRelease">We released results</a> that showed, for the first time, evidence for the presence of a stochastic gravitational wave background permeating the Universe at nanohertz frequencies. 

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2EKbvnee3o">Here's a great video</a> summarizing our work with this dataset, and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkdyVA0xiVI">press conference at NSF headquarters announcing our results</a>.

In addition to <a href="https://nanograv.org/15yr/Summary/Anisotropy">leading the search for anisotropy in the gravitational wave background</a>, I also developed the noise analysis framework for <a href="https://nanograv.org/15yr/Summary/Timing">the timing analyses</a>, led the simulations team in the search for the isotropic background, co-led the investigation of the monopole, and was one of the people who wrote the <a href="https://nanograv.org/15yr/Summary/Background">paper showing evidence for the isotropic background</a>.
